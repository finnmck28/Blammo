def instructions():
    print("""At the start of the game pick a case.
This case has anywhere between 1 cent and
1 million dollars, so choose carefully!

Then answer science questions and eliminate
the remaining cases available.

Every few questions you will get an offer
of money. The more questions you get right
prior to the offer, the better the offer
will be. You may either except the offer
and end the game there, or decline the offer
and keep eliminating cases and answering
questions.

If all cases are eliminated, you get to
open the case you chose at the beginning
and keep the money inside. Hopefully you
chose well!

Have fun playing - the Blammo! team""")
