    print("""Your aim is to maximise the amount of money you win.
The game begins with 20 cases, each with a different
(unkown) cash amount in them.

Start by picking one case out of the 20. Next answer
a science question, and then eliminate one of the
remaining cases. You will repeat this process a few
times. Every so often, you will get a cash offer. If
you answer the science questions correctly, you will
get a higher offer. Answer them wrong and you get a
lower one.

The game ends when you either accept an offer or
eliminate all the cases except your one, where
you get the amount of money in the case.

Good luck!

The team at Blammo!""")
