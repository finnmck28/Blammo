    print("""\nBlammo! is a really simple game. Here's how you play:

Your aim is to maximise the amount of money you win.
The game begins with 20 cases, each with a different
(unknown) cash amount in them.

Start by picking one case out of the 20. Next you
will answer a science question, and then eliminate
one of the remaining cases. You will repeat this
process a few times. Every so often, you will get
a cash offer. If you answer the science questions
correctly, you will get a higher offer. Answer
them wrong and you get a lower one.

The game ends when you either accept an offer or
eliminate all the cases, in which case you get
the amount of money in your case.

Have fun playing and good luck!

The team at Blammo!""")
